# openidconnect_windows

Windows implementation for the Flutter OpenIdConnect package. For usage instructions please see https://pub.dev/openidconnect.

Because this project is endorsed by the openidconnect project, you need not add it to your pubspec.yaml, only the root openidconnect dependancy.

**Note**
This package will be depreciated once windows support is natively added to webview.
