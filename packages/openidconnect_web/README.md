# openidconnect_web

Web implementation for the Flutter OpenIdConnect package. For usage instructions please see https://pub.dev/packages/openidconnect.

Because this project is endorsed by the openidconnect project, you need not add it to your pubspec.yaml, only the root openidconnect dependancy.

**Note**
Ensure that you copy the callback.html file into your web folder of your project so that interactive authentication will work correctly.
